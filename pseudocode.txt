Pseudocode for each script we need to write

=================================
I. Filter out reads by timepoint
=================================

Look into: Biophython (SeqIO)

Input: Fastq file

0. Generate test files
	- stackoverflow
	- read in a few lines and write into new file (250 sequences)
	- yay test file

1. Use Biopython to read in the fastq data
	=== Ina ===
	- input: fastaq data
	- object: seq, quality, index
	- output: pickle

1b. Distance between barcodes
	=== Steven ===
	input: barcode library, identifier library
	- function to calculate distance between two sequences of the same length
		a. calculate distribution of distances in barcode library
		b. calculate distribution of distances in identifier library
	- determine thresholds
	output: function, thresholds

2. Filtering our data + lambda phage 
	=== Bruk ===
	[- decide if it's easier to filter first or to filter after Biopython]
	- input: pickle file
	- look through index part of the description line
	- save into new pickles
		- 1-6 of time points
		- lambda phage
	- output: pickle files

3. Filtering by quality and reads
	=== Ina ===
	input: multiple pickle files, dictionary of barcodes{barcode: 0}
	a. filter by low quality number in sequence
		- none reads
		- quality cutoff (20 or 30)
			- use Galaxy (Bruk)
		- throw away all sequences that have one bad read]
	b. by non-barcode length
		- thrown away
	c. calculate distance to barcodes in library
		- determine length (different task)
		- throw away those that really don't match
		- combine those that match
	output: dictionary {barcode: count}

4. Map into amino acid space
	=== Lillian ===
	- input: dictionary {barcode: count}, library dictionary {barcode: [pos, aa]}
	- function that go from barcode to [pos, aa]
	- count barcodes into a [pos, aa] dictionary (duplicates for barcodes)
	- output: dictionary {[pos, aa]: count}

5. Calculate error from lambda phage
	- calculate infidelities with the lambda phage (use distance function)


Output: dictionaries of
